Output them to the screen like so: "I will be either NN or NN in YYYY", substituting the values.

var birthYear = 1997;
var futureYear = 2023;
var age1 = futureYear - birthYear;
var age2 = age1 - 1;

var currentAge = 25; // current age in years
var maxAge = 80; // maximum age in years
var snacksPerDay = 2; // estimated amount of snacks per day
var yearsRemaining = maxAge - currentAge; // calculate how many years you have left
var daysRemaining = yearsRemaining * 365; // calculate how many days you have left
var totalSnacks = daysRemaining * snacksPerDay; // calculate the total number of snacks
console.log("You will need " + totalSnacks + " snacks to last you until the ripe old age of " + maxAge + ".");
